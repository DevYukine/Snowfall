    "Description": "Snowfall\nLet your materia fall like snow.\n\nTired of clicking \"Begin\" and \"Yes\" every time you need to clear out gear? Snowfall adds a simple Retrieve All Materia button to your right-click menu.\n\nOnce clicked, the plugin takes over: it opens the retrieval window, confirms the prompts, and loops until your item is empty. It’s fast, reliable, and keeps the menu-mashing to a minimum.",
